# SolPulse - Challenges & Solutions

## Overview
SolPulse is a crypto-based social media platform built from scratch, integrating real-time updates, authentication, and WebSockets for seamless user interactions. During development, several key challenges were encountered and resolved through iterative problem-solving.

## Biggest Challenges & How They Were Overcome

### **1. Debugging and Fixing Hundreds of Bugs**
- **Challenge:**  
  - Building SolPulse from scratch without a tutorial meant encountering **hundreds of bugs** across the backend and frontend.  
  - Issues ranged from **authentication failures**, **database inconsistencies**, **WebSocket errors**, and **React-Express integration issues**.  

- **Solution:**  
  Adopted a **systematic debugging approach**:  
  - Used **logging** (console logs & backend logs) to pinpoint failures.  
  - Tested API endpoints independently using **Insomnia/Postman** before integrating them into the frontend.  
  - Implemented **Cypress testing** to increase reliability.  
  - Tracked bugs systematically, isolated failures, and iterated on fixes.

### **2. Authentication Issues (JWT & AuthProvider Context)**
- **Challenge:**  
  - Authentication was inconsistent, with **JWT tokens failing to persist** across sessions.  
  - Tokens sometimes **failed validation**, and authentication state management was inefficient.  
  - `AuthProvider` needed **refinement** to avoid unnecessary re-renders or stale auth states.  

- **Solution:**  
  Standardized **JWT token handling**:  
  - Ensured **Authorization headers** were correctly passed in all API requests.  
  - Implemented **proper token refreshing mechanisms**.  
  - Moved authentication logic into `AuthProvider`, **reducing redundant state changes**.

### **3. WebSocket Communication & Real-Time Updates**
- **Challenge:**  
  - WebSockets **weren't triggering updates reliably** for real-time posts/interactions.  
  - The `/test-websocket-event` endpoint was **occasionally unresponsive** or failed due to incorrect `Authorization` headers.  
  - Some messages were **delayed or dropped** due to unstable connections.  

- **Solution:**  
 Refactored **WebSocket logic**:  
  - Verified **backend route accessibility** and ensured **correct CORS settings**.  
  - Implemented **connection retries and heartbeats** to maintain stability.  
  - Optimized **Redux/React state handling** to ensure UI updates when receiving new messages/events.

### **4. API Deployment (Render & CoinGecko Integration)**
- **Challenge:**  
  - Initially considered multiple hosting options before settling on **Render.com** for the backend and **Supabase** for the database.  
  - Encountered **API connectivity issues**, and `.env` variables were **not loading correctly**.  
  - **CoinGecko API requests** needed rate limit handling to prevent failures.  

- **Solution:**  
  Fixed **deployment configurations**:  
  - Ensured **`.env` variables** were correctly set in Render.  
  - Implemented **request throttling** to avoid exceeding CoinGecko’s rate limits.  
  - Simplified infrastructure by **removing Supabase**, using only Render for deployment.  

---

### **5. Cypress Tests Failing in CI**
- **Challenge:**  
  - Integration tests were **failing intermittently**, especially for routes like `/users/me` and `/test-websocket-event`.  
  - **Cypress was timing out** on API calls, causing flaky tests.  
  - Authentication tests **weren’t working consistently** due to JWT expiration issues.  

- **Solution:**  
  Refined **test setup**:  
  - Ensured Cypress used a **valid JWT token** in all requests.  
  - Added **backend logging** to diagnose `/users/me` failures.  
  - Increased **timeouts** for API calls where necessary.

### **6. Frontend UI/UX Polish**
- **Challenge:**  
  - Ensuring **Tailwind CSS code remained maintainable** and scalable.  
  - Implementing **dark mode** and **responsive layouts** efficiently.  
  - Needed to add **animations & micro-interactions** to improve the user experience.  

- **Solution:**  
  Refactored **Tailwind usage**:  
  - Used **reusable component classes** instead of inline Tailwind everywhere.  
  - Added **Framer Motion** for smooth animations.  
  - Ensured a **mobile-first, fully responsive design**.  

---

### **7. Database Relationships and Query Optimization**
- **Challenge:**  
  - Defining relationships between **User, Post, and Like models** in Sequelize.  
  - Some database queries were **inefficient**, leading to slow responses under load.  

- **Solution:**  
  Optimized **database queries**:  
  - Added **indexes** to frequently queried fields.  
  - Used **lazy loading** to prevent excessive data fetching.  
  - Implemented **pagination** to reduce large API payloads.  

---

### **8. Financial Constraints & Mental Resilience**
- **Challenge:**  
  - Running **low on funds** while trying to complete SolPulse.  
  - Pushing through **long nights debugging** without external help.  

- **Solution:**  
  Stayed **determined and resourceful**:  
  - Took a **methodical approach** to problem-solving instead of burning out.  
  - Leveraged **community help, StackOverflow, and deep debugging techniques**.  
  - Kept refining and iterating **instead of giving up** when things didn’t work.  

---

## **Key Takeaways**
- **Deep Debugging Skills:** Solved authentication, WebSockets, and API issues through logging & testing.  
- **Performance Optimization:** Improved database efficiency, WebSocket reliability, and API response times.  
- **Authentication & Security:** Mastered JWT handling and frontend authentication flow.  
- **Testing & CI/CD:** Stabilized Cypress tests and automated API validation.  
- **Deployment & Scaling:** Configured hosting, optimized API requests, and handled rate limits.  

SolPulse was built **entirely from scratch**, overcoming these challenges through a combination of **problem-solving, iteration, and technical expertise**.
