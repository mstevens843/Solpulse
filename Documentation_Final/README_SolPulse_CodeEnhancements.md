# 🔧 SolPulse: Codebase Enhancements & Refactors Summary

> **Updated:** 2025-03-23

This document outlines all the **code improvements**, **optimizations**, and **refactors** implemented across the SolPulse project so far. It includes both frontend and backend progress, feature additions, and foundational improvements that enhance scalability, maintainability, and user experience.

---

## 📦 Project Scope

SolPulse is a full-stack social crypto dashboard for the Solana ecosystem. It features wallet integration, user-to-user tipping, real-time market data, and social functionality — all while staying performance-optimized and visually polished with Tailwind CSS.

---

## ✅ Summary of Enhancements

### 🔄 Global Improvements
- ✅ Replaced all `process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL` with `import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL` (Vite compatibility)
- ✅ Consolidated Tailwind styles into dedicated `.css` files (no inline styles)
- ✅ Added reusable `FallbackImage` component for handling failed image loads across pages
- ✅ Added global error handling consistency across API fetch logic
- ✅ Created and migrated 2 new database migration files for additional backend support
- ✅ Improved accessibility: `aria-label`, better tab indexes, form semantics
- ✅ Refined page/component structure: clearly separated pages from reusable components

---

## ⚙️ Backend Optimizations

### 🧠 Authentication & Routes
- ✅ Refactored `AuthProvider` to avoid using `useContext` directly across components
- ✅ Simplified and cleaned up `/users` and `/auth` routes
- ✅ Separated token logic, added clearer prop types and input validation
- ✅ Implemented reusable middleware across authenticated endpoints

### 🗃️ Models
- ✅ Ensured all Sequelize models (`User`, `Post`, etc.) follow singular naming convention
- ✅ Cleaned up associations and ensured cascade deletion works properly
- ✅ Added timestamp support to key models where relevant (e.g., tips, messages)

### 🧪 Testing
- ✅ Setup full test suite (Jest, Supertest)
- ✅ All routes tested: auth, user, tip, feed, notifications, messages
- ✅ Cypress tests for critical user flows (signup, login, tip)

---

- ✅ Debounced search and API calls
- ✅ Modal popup for individual coin chart
- ✅ Chart shows timeframe (1D, 7D, 30D, 90D) — fetches data on demand
- ✅ Data fetch optimization and reduced redundant requests

---

## 📁 Folder Structure Cleanup
