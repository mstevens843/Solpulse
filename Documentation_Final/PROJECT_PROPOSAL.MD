# SolPulse - Project Proposal

## Project Overview
**SolPulse** is a **crypto-focused social media platform** designed for **Solana enthusiasts and traders** to connect, share content, and trade directly from their dashboard. It integrates **real-time cryptocurrency data**, **crypto tipping**, and **wallet-based authentication** to create a decentralized space for meaningful crypto discussions.

### Problem Statement
Traditional social media platforms:
- Lack incentives for high-quality content.
- Do not integrate **real-time crypto market data**.
- Do not allow **peer-to-peer tipping using cryptocurrencies**.
- Are centralized, limiting user ownership and financial interactions.
- "Crypto Twitter" can migrate to their own platform. 

**Solution:**  
SolPulse introduces **Solana-based tipping and trading**, allowing users to **earn and send SOL** for engaging content, interact with **live market data**, and stay updated on **trending tokens** in the Solana ecosystem.
