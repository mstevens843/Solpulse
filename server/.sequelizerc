const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  'config': path.resolve('config', 'config.js'), // Path to your config file
  'models-path': path.resolve('models'),        // Path to your models folder
  'seeders-path': path.resolve('seeders'),      // Path to your seeders folder
  'migrations-path': path.resolve('migrations') // Path to your migrations folder
};


// Steps to Add the File
// Create a file named .sequelizerc in the root of your project directory.
// Paste the above code into it and save.
// Explanation
// config: Points to the Sequelize configuration file for environment settings (development, test, production).
// models-path: Specifies the directory where your models are stored.
// seeders-path: Specifies the directory for seeders (e.g., seeders folder).
// migrations-path: Specifies the directory for migrations (e.g., migrations folder).
// Benefits
// Prevents Sequelize from creating unexpected nested folders like seeders/seeders.
// Ensures all CLI operations (db:migrate, db:seed:all, etc.) work seamlessly with the correct folder structure.
// Once added, this file ensures a clean and consistent project structure!

// Run npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all to confirm everything works as expected.
